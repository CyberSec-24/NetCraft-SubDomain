Whois is a query and response protocol used for querying databases that store the registered users or
assignees of an Internet resource, such as a domain name, an IP address block, or an autonomous system. This protocol listens to requests on port 43 (TCP). 
Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) maintain Whois databases, which contain the personal information of domain owners

▪ Thick Whois (Distributed Model) - Stores the complete Whois information from all the registrars for a particular set of data.
▪ Thin Whois (Centralized Model) - Stores only the name of the Whois server of the registrar of a domain, which in turn holds complete details on the data being looked up.
▪ Decentralized Whois - Stores complete WHOIS information and has multiple independent entities to manage the WHOIS database

An attacker can query a Whois database server to obtain information regarding the target domain, and the Whois server responds to the query with the requested information.
